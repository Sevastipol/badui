Developers at IKEA have recently implemented a new cutting-edge security feature, one developer claims that it is "impossible" for robots to solve.
If you really want a Blåhaj, you are going to have to work for it.

HOW TO PLAY:
---------------------------
The user has to pass a newly implemented captcha verification to buy the Blåhaj. To do this, click the 'i am not a robot' button and then solve the captcha,
the captcha requires the user to select all the bats, but is unspecific on which type. (you must **choose all the bats which are animals**, and none of the baseball bats)
Once you've selected the bats, click submit.

WHEN SOLVED:
---------------------------
 If you've correctly done this, the item will go out of stock just as you solve the captcha. You will then need to wait a few seconds for the Blåhajs to be restocked.

IN STOCK:
---------------------------
Click on the icon next to the shopping cart, on the left. Then, input a username and a password of atleast 8 characters.
You will have to verify you are a human by completing another captcha. If you are stuck, ensure you are selecting a white flower with a coloured dot in the middle.
Once you have finished the captcha, your account will be created.

Simply click **Add to shopping cart** and the Blåhaj is yours! (you will have to decide if you want to buy some recomendations ofc)

After that, click the button to proceed to checkout, then click complete payment!
The shark is now yours.
